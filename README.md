# [Fever Detection Web Dashboard](https://spectrumcet.com/feverdet/)

NodeMCU ESP8266 is used with the library exported by edge impulse. 
In this system, integration of the MLX90614 sensor to measure the temperature of a personâ€™s finger with the NodeMCU ESP8266 is done and prediction of a person having fever or
not is done.

The prediction will be done by a machine learning algorithm which will find the nearest neighbour to the data given.

The results obtained from the Machine Learning model is being updated live in this Web Dashboard which will be only accessible by Authorized medical teams and the family members of the patient/person.
